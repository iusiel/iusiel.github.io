This week, I did a practice 5k run to find out what pace I can run right now. I aimed for a 35:00 time (7 minutes per km), but I ended up at 36:32. It was a somewhat hard run for me so for the coming days, I will just be focusing on training and not trying to strain myself. Even though it was hard, I enjoyed it. I employed a negative split strategy for this run. For the next run, I will try a positive split strategy.

I can't find the motivation to write the story I am doing so I shifted my focus to the storybook software. I am encountering some weird issues regarding CSRF implementation, so I decided to focus on the main feature right now which is the showing of the story. I am satisfied with my progress and I hope to finish this side project before June this year.
