I updated the look of the run journal so that it will look more like a "journal". It now functions by showing a run per page. I still maintained some of the other pages that I had created. I am satisfied with the update though I still like to implement more updates.

I continued studying chess. I have managed to reach a 2000 puzzle rating on Lichess. I hope I can consistently stay there. Sometimes I feel like the things that I cannot apply the things that I have learned to real games. Anyway, I am enjoying the process right now and I hope to continue enjoying it in the future.
