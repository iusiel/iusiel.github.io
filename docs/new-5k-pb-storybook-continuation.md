My former attempt for a 5k PB was 36:32. I was able to record a 35:47 time this time around. I felt strong during this run though the last hilly part was hard. I am glad that I was able to see some improvement. My target for the next time I attempt a 5K PB will be 35:00.

I also made some progress while working on the storybook software. I added swipe functionality for page navigation purposes. I have also added an audio player that will play some background music according to the page that the user is currently reading. I am still in the middle of fine-tuning these functions and hopefully, by the end of next week, they will be more robust and less prone to bugs.
