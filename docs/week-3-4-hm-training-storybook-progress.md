The highlight of my week 3 training is the weekend long run that was about 90 minutes. I think this was the longest that I have run since I did a half-marathon back in 2019. I felt great during the first half of this run. I was targeting about 7:44 min/second pace but I was able to break the 7:30 pace for some part without thinking too much about it. I think I paid for that in the second half because I could feel my breath running out, especially during the last 15 minutes. Overall, I felt great during this run. I was able to log 11 kms for this run. Because of this run, I will change my strategy for my next long run. I don't want to feel winded after my next long run is finished.

For my week 4 training, the run that I enjoyed the most is the speed repeats session. I enjoyed it because the day before, I skipped my workout due to feeling some muscle tightness in my right calf. I was worried that I would have to skip my next workouts so I was pretty glad that I was able to run my next workout. The speed repeats also provided a change of pace because I was forced to run beyond the race pace that I am planning to use. For the week 4 long run, the first half is a hill climb so I adjusted the pace for this one. The second half is my regular pace for long runs. I did this so that I can see how I will perform if I am feeling somewhat tired. I am glad that I was not feeling that sore after my week 4 long run.

For the storybook development, I finished creating the basic database structure for the story section. I think I did pretty fine on that one. I also ran the pages I have built through Lighthouse to fix some issues that are related to page speed and SEO. The storybook development has been quite slow in my opinion, but I am glad that I was able to make some progress over the past weeks.
