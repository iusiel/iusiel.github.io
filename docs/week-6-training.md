My week 6 training is mostly focused on speed sessions. There was also no long-run scheduled for this week so my mileage is lower compared to previous weeks. The week was somewhat easier compared to previous weeks, but my progression was really hard. I wanted to make my progression run a hard session so I tried to maintain my pace while running on hills. The final minutes of my progression run were particularly nasty but I am glad that I was able to finish it in one piece.

As for unrelated things, it was nice catching up with some of my old work colleagues. I think I don't have that many meaningful relationships so I should try to maintain the few ones that I have.
