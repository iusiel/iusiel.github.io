I am frustrated with my chess games right now. I am missing some easy blunders. Fortunately, my chess puzzle-solving has not suffered. I think I just have to find a way so that my chess puzzle-solving will translate into my real play.

In other updates, I have not yet been able to apply the learnings that I have read from retrieval practice. I hope I can finally apply it consistently.
