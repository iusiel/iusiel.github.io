Some friends have invited me to play Rainbow Six Siege. At first, I thought it would only be just your typical run-and-gun FPS, but it was not like that. Compared to the other mainstream FPS (First Person Shooter) games, R6 siege is a more team-oriented game. You have to communicate constantly with your teammates to be good at this game. So when my teammates started talking about rooms and map callouts, I don't understand anything at all. It was really hard to make any sense of what they are saying.

Upon using Google search, people say that you have to generally have map knowledge to enjoy R6 siege. So now, what I am doing is map training. I hope that this training will help me though I find the training boring.
