I took a week-long VL so that I could focus on other things other than work. I was able to do some things related to my side projects. I started my portfolio revamp. I also started working on a randomizer for "legendary palm tree" that will determine what topic should I research. I also found an interesting podcast related to leaves. I'll try to apply it in the future. This is the link to the podcast if you are interested <a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife/the-science-of-recharging-on-weekends-and-vacations-transcript" rel="noopener">The Science of Recharging on Weekends and Vacations</a>.

At the start of the month, I planned to up my mileage by doing more exercises related to running. Unfortunately, for my first run of the month, I rolled my ankle pretty badly. I am frustrated because I was just seconds away from my cooldown before I rolled my ankle. I think nothing was broken though I can feel some pain. That is why I am careful as much as possible. I think I am going to rest my ankle for about 2 weeks before I start running again.
