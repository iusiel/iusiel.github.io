I found out about Petite Vue from a podcast. At first, I thought it was an optimized version of Vue, but it looks like it was made so that you can enjoy some features of Vue without installing Vue.JS itself. I also found it easy to use. I enjoyed trying this one out though I am not sure if I will use it on my future projects. Maybe I can try to find some use for it. I could also try implementing Petite Vue on an existing application that already uses Vue.JS and find out how much I need to change so that Petite Vue will work properly.
