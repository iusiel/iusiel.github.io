There was not much progress in the story that I am trying to write. I hope that I can do better in the coming weeks. As for the storybook site that I am developing, I am encountering a weird bug right now when trying to implement CSRF protection on the login form. The code that I used is the same as the one I used in the Lap Times Saver site, but it is not working properly. I am wondering what should I do about the bug. For the storybook, I gave myself a deadline at the end of February on whether to continue this or not. I realized that setting six months developing the application does not help with my motivation at all. What I changed for now is to just take it month by month and see whether I still want to continue.

I also started regular practice for playing the guitar. Right now, my routine is setting five minutes for each chord that I am trying to play, and then one minute for chord changes. Right now, I am focusing on the A and D chords. I only started https://www.justinguitar.com/, but I feel that it is a big help for beginners that has no idea where to start. I hope my motivation for learning the guitar will not easily fade. It will be pretty sweet for me to pick up this skill this year.
