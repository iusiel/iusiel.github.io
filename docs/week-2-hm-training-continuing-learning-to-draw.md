I have finished all my workouts for the week two training. I enjoyed my long weekend run and I did pretty well in my opinion. The planned week 3 long run is quite daunting since it is a minimum 50-minute run and a maximum 80-minute run. As usual, I am going to aim for the 80-minute run though I am still trying to figure out if I will go on a easy pace all the way or if I will try to add some faster pace running in between. I am experiencing some shoulder discomfort right now. I am wondering if it is somewhat related to my running training. I will train as usual for the upcoming week unless I experience more pain.

I am also implementing a new routine so that I can continue learning how to draw. I have mixed the lessons from https://drawabox.com/ and https://colourcow.com/picasso-exercise/ so that I will not easily get bored. I hope I will not lose the motivation and discipline to keep working on this one.
