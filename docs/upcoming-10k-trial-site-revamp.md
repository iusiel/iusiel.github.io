I did my final long run before my 10k time trial. It was supposed to be 10 miles but I reduced it to about 5 miles because I think that 10 miles is too long. I am glad that I finished this long run. After the training block, I felt that the goal that I was trying to achieve (50:00 min 10k) was not within reach. I think I am not there yet so I will not push very hard to meet the 50:00 time during the time trial. I hope I can finish it below 1 hour though I think I will finish somewhere around 1:00:00 and 1:10:00. I just have to put faith in all the training that I have done.

I am also planning to revamp the look of my portfolio site. I am not sure how I will proceed with it. What I am planning right now is to remove the About Me page and then put the relevant section on the homepage. I am also planning to add some blog links to the homepage. I am also contemplating if I should switch to Astro but for now, I think I will continue using VitePress for my portfolio site.
