I have finished the main functionality of <a href="https://probable-train.netlify.app/" target="_blank">probable-train</a>. The main page will redirect me to a random card page. The other pages present on the site are the all decks page and the particular deck page. It was pretty nice doing this on Astro. I learned some new stuff while developing this. Since this is a static site generator, the home page will always remain constant. That is why I updated the home page functionality to redirect to a random card page.

I also had a good victory while playing on Lichess. I was down a minor piece, but I was able to mask my plan for the checkmate. My opponent was not able to anticipate so that led me to winning. Right now, I am concerned that I am not able to retain even ground on my materials. Even in my victories, I am always down on pieces so I think this can be a major point of improvement.
