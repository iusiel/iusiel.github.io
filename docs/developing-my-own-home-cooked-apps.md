I stumbled upon an interesting episode on <a target="_blank" href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">ShopTalkShow</a> about <a target="_blank" href="https://shoptalkshow.com/609/">home cooked apps</a>. At first, I was not sure what it was but as I listened and researched about it more, I understood what it was. Simply put, these are applications that you developed to solve your own problems. You have no intention of selling it or sharing it with anyone so you just try to solve the problem you are encountering. I have already done this with some of my personal projects, but it was nice to know that other developers also do it. I think that this approach is good especially when you are just trying to do some code work and not trying to create the next big thing. On another note, I hope I can continue developing my own projects. I think that it has stalled for quite some time now and I would like to make more progress in the coming weeks.
