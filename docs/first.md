<script setup>
import BlogPost from './.vitepress/theme/components/BlogPost.vue'
</script>

<BlogPost>
  <div>
I am not really sure what to put here. I just decided to add a blog section since most portfolio sites have one. I would like this to be a repository for things that I have learned, skills I want to improve, and things I want to share with anyone (if there will ever be people reading this). For now, I will mostly write about web development, some leadership and soft skills that I have learned, and random stuff I enjoy pursuing right now.

Till my next post then.
