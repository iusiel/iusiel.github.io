I think the year is off to a good start though I have already encountered some difficulties. There was a time when I was frustrated with my chess problems since I couldn't seem to win and I couldn't solve the chess puzzles consistently. I was frustrated during that time. Because of that, I decided to take a bit of "chess detox". I think it helped overall because I was able to get into a good mindset. I intently looked at how I played. I think because of that, I had a better grasp on how I should play.

I am also regularly running again though it is still walk-run sessions. I am aiming to run for 4 days a week. I am targeting this because this was my training schedule when I ran my half-marathon personal best. I have also started modifying how the run journal works.

I am not yet able to do my 2023 year-end review. I hope I can do it in the upcoming days.
