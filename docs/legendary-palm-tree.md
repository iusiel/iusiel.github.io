As I was looking back at some things that I have added to my Notion account, I noticed that I wanted to explore a lot of things that I heard while listening to podcasts. Unfortunately, I was not able to maintain it regularly. What I am now planning to do is to try and use these web technologies at least 30 minutes per session with a max of 3 sessions and then decide if it is worthwhile to pursue or not. I hope that with this plan, I can tackle all the things that I want to learn regarding web development.

On an unrelated note, I ran my 10k time trial last October 22. I was not able to meet the goals that I had set. However, I am still proud of what I have accomplished since I finished it even if I was having a hard time. Hopefully, my next 10k time trial will go more smoothly.
