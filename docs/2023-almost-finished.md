The year is almost finished. I started running regularly again. I hope to make running permanent in my lifestyle. Late this year, I have also started playing chess again. I only play a few times against humans. I focus more on chess puzzles and reading chess books. It's been fun learning new things about chess. I wish that I tried to be more serious when I was still younger.

As for web technologies, I started using some static site generators for my projects. I used Astro and more recently Svelte (I am still new to Svelte). It's been fun studying them. I also created "Legendary Palm Tree" so that I can test more web things that I learn from listening to various podcasts. I hope that I will continue to learn more in the upcoming year.

I have not done my year-end review yet. I think I will do it tomorrow at the start of the new year. Right now, I would say my main goals for my personal life are to run throughout the whole year injury-free, become a better chess player, become a better guitar player, and start creating a game via RPG Maker.
