I was looking for some good puzzle books. For some reason, it just went to me trying out chess again. I used to play while I was young but not that often. I just know the basic rules. Upon researching about chess, it looks like I have many things to learn about. For now, I am going to read some chess books that are recommended by users. I am going to start with three, How To Beat Your Dad at Chess, Logical Chess Move by Move, and Winning Chess Tactics. I hope that I will push through with learning chess. I am also planning to buy a chess board though not a premium one. Hope that playing chess will help me with my logical thinking.

As for my rolled ankle, it looks like it is starting to heal. It looks like I will not be running anytime soon. I am aiming to walk regularly. I still can't bend my ankle properly so it looks like it still needs more time to heal. Right now, my estimate would be to run again at the start of December.
