For the upcoming year, I want to continue improving myself. I want to learn more about web development, especially the current trends and tech used and developed by the major players in the industry. I want to finish at least one major side project this year. I have started development on a "storybook" app.

For this outside web development, I want to continue improving my critical thinking. I also want to improve my knowledge of current local and international events. I am also trying to learn how to play the guitar. I am currently improving my writing skills. I want to write a story that can be enjoyed by anyone.
