I have managed to create a training that I will use when trying to improve my chess and Tekken skills. I hope that I can be consistent with it.

I have started reading 100 Endgames by Jesus de la Villa. So far I am enjoying reading it. I also bought Mastering Chess Strategy by Johan Hellsten. I'll also start reading it later as I am planning to tackle the endgame, middlegame, and opening while studying chess. I decided on this approach because I think I will not get bored by this system.

I also had a nice break this past week so I am feeling a bit refreshed. Hope that this will carry on to the week ahead.
