For the chess helper app, I have managed to start 4 pages. They are per-game analysis, macro analysis of all games, microanalysis, and endgame selector. So far, I have done all of them without using any database. I think I can finish this one without needing to switch to Symfony. I hope to make some significant progress in the coming weeks.

I played a rapid game in Lichess. It was a bit anticlimactic because the game ended so abruptly. I thought I was in a bad position but after I made my move, I realized that my opponent blundered pretty badly. Looks like I need to be better at evaluating the current position so I can spot blunders easily.
