I am planning to run a "10k event" this October 15. To prepare for it, I created a custom plan based on Matt Fitzgerald's 80/20 plan for 10k. I allotted 15 weeks for my training. I just finished week 6 this past week. The highlight for week 6 I guess is the long run. I tried to do an 8-mile run though I have not been able to do long runs this past few weeks due to bad weather. Unfortunately for me, I gave up around the remaining 2.4 km. My diagnosis for this one is that my pace is just a bit too fast. I will attempt this long run again in week 8 but I will start more slowly.

My target for the 10k run is 50 minutes though with how I think my training is going so far, I think I should target 55 minutes to 1 hour.
