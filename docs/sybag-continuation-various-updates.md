I managed to finish the basic functions for the SYBAG projects. It now recommends that you should buy a game according to your games list. The game management function is also complete. You can now add, edit or delete a game in your list. I am just trying to implement vitest but I am having a hard time right now. I think I will just stop trying to use vitest if it proves to be difficult to do.

I am excited to start some of my planned side projects. After finishing SYBAG, I think I will work on my run tracker and game tracker. I am not sure about the stack that I will use, but I want to try using Astro for this side projects.

On unrelated dev updates, I am training for a 10K run. The weather has not been good so far so I am not able to train consistently. I also started playing League of Legends again. It is still a fun game for me though I prefer to play with friends rather than trying to solo queue right now.
