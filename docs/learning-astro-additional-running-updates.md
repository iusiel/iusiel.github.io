I learned about Astro because I heard about it from <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/" rel="noopener">Shoptalkshow</a> and <a href="https://syntax.fm/" rel="noopener">Syntax.FM</a>. I was familiar with VitePress so I tried using this one. So far, it looks like Astro works somewhat similarly to VitePress. Because of that, I was already familiar with its basic concepts. The tutorial provided on their website is good. I think it covers all the basics you need to create a decent website using Astro. What I like about it is the syntax is somewhat the same as VitePress. For my first project using Astro, I think I will create a running tracker. You can check the <a href="https://astro.build/" rel="noopener">Astro website</a> for more details.

In my running update, I decided to use perceived effort when running my easy paces. I found that I enjoyed the last training run that I did because I just ran with how I felt. I think this is better for me so that I don't get burnt out easily. For the harder training sessions, I'll stick to using paces because it will keep me honest I think.
