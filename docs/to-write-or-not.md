One thing that I always wanted to do was write a story for a game. Like many others, I manage to write something but then get discouraged halfway through until I stop finishing that particular story.

I have made it my goal this year to finish a story I have started writing. So far, I have created some general outlines that I will use for this story. So far, the premise will revolve around two things "light" and "darkness". The "light" and "darkness" are not the natural things we experience but rather some unexplained phenomena that have drastic effects on the people living. If you are familiar with the game ["Legend of Legaia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Legaia), that is where I got the inspiration for this story. I want to finish this story before 2023 since this is one of my year-end goals.

I stumbled into this article from the Economist [What to read to become a better writer](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/09/09/what-to-read-to-become-a-better-writer). I liked the contents of the article. Because of that, I am trying to read the recommendations they have mentioned. I have started reading [Politics and the English Language by George Orwell](https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit). I hope that this will help me in finishing the story and help me become a better writer.
