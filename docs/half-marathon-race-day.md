The month of May has been quite hectic. That is why I am not able to give updates regularly. Overall, I think my April training went well. I thought that my good training will continue through May. Unfortunately, that is what did not happen. I got sick so I was forced to miss about a week's worth of running workouts. I also got sidelined in my training because I was also focusing on some other things.  I also lost confidence along the way because I felt that I am not doing well in my last workouts even though I am not running at my target goal pace. My sleep schedule was also out of whack so I felt that I am not recovering well enough.

Race day is here. I tried to get some sleep but I was not able to. I will try to implement a simple strategy for this race. I will divide this race into three main parts with each part consisting of 7 km. For the first 7 km, I am planning to run at a pace of 7:27. For km 8-14, I will run at my intended goal pace of 7:07. For the final 7 kilometers if I can, I will try to run at a pace of 6:47. I planned to do a negative split for this race.

For the first 7 km, I felt fine and I was able to follow my strategy properly. The only setback is that I was slower on the first kilometer since I can't separate myself from the crowd. For the next 7 km, I was starting to feel some aches, but I was able to run at my goal pace with no issue at all. For the final 7 km, I am starting to feel tired. I was able to run km 15-17 at my intended pace, but I am starting to feel the aches. I also started to do some walk breaks. Kilometer 20 is where I felt that I just wanted to give up. I took a very long walk break around here. I thought that it was the end for me. But I managed to find the strength to finish the remaining two kilometers by implementing a sprint walk strategy. I was surprised that I was able to maintain a good pace by using this strategy. The final part before the finish line was a bit comedic because I took a walk break not realizing that I was near the finish line. When I saw the finish line, I just sprinted all the way. Overall, my unofficial time is 02:30:29 (I am not yet able to confirm the initial results). I was off by 29 seconds on my target, but I am proud of this run. My confidence was low before the race so I thought that I will not be near my target goal. I also learned new things about myself during this run. Looks like I can maintain a walk-sprint strategy even if I am already tired.

Here are my times per km:

-   KM 1 - 8:09
-   KM 2 - 7:16
-   KM 3 - 7:21

The month of May was hectic for me because I felt that I was not able to do many things. This June, I hope to bring some normalcy back to my routines.
