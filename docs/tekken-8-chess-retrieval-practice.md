I have started playing Tekken 8. I find it enjoyable especially since I am trying new characters. Right now, I am using Jun, Kazuya, and Reina. I think I am going to be a Jun since I enjoy playing her. I do not intend to play online ranked, but I want to play with others from my gaming circle. I also appreciate the ghost function. Maybe I'll try downloading some high-ranked player's ghost and see if I can beat it.

I have managed to break 2100 on my Lichess puzzle rating. I hope I can maintain this rating. I tried playing against Stockfish again. I am not sure but I feel that my chess has not improved at all. Maybe I can verify this by playing other people online. Nonetheless, I am still enjoying the learning process though sometimes I feel that my progress is very slow.

I am trying a new approach in chess training taking inspiration from retrieval practice. I learned about it after listening to this podcast episode from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpcgQpppDOQ" target="_blank">Perpetual Chess Podcast</a>. It really resonated with me and I hope to apply it to other aspects of my learning, especially while studying chess and Tekken 8.
