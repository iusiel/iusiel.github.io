I have finished developing the run journal via <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>. It was a very interesting experience for me. I liked the Astro.glob() function and the frontmatter syntax since it allowed me to do some things without needing a dedicated backend language. This is how it looks right now:

It looks pretty simple right now but I am planning to add some slick things like animations so that it will not look like a simple web application. While developing the run journal, it also made me look back at the progress I made this year with regard to running. Overall, I am proud of how my running went this year. I hope that I can end it on a good note. I hope my 10K trial on October 15 will be something that I can be proud of.

As for other updates, I bought a FiiO BTR5 Bluetooth DAC and Moondrop Chu 2. Because of this, I found myself listening to music more in the past days. My guitar training is also going well though I feel that my progress is slow. I am also playing Persona 4 Golden again. For this particular run, I am trying an Izanagi-only run. I thought it would be hard, but after I equipped Izanagi with the four basic elemental skills, I found that the run had become easy. Maybe I'll add additional modifiers if I try this run again like increasing the difficulty or not having Izanagi learn all the basic elemental skills.
