I feel that this is a little bit late since it is already the 22nd of January, but better late than never I guess. For the past year, I think that I tried to push and break some limits that I have. I started to listen to various podcasts so that I can learn new things and improve my existing knowledge. The podcasts that I listened to ranged from web development topics to how to improve the current work experience. I learned a lot from them last year and I hope that I continue to learn from them in 2023.

Here are some of my favorite podcast episodes:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2022/04/05/yanss-229-britt-franks-advice-for-escaping-life-loops-dealing-with-trauma-and-building-the-psychological-momentum-required-to-get-yourself-unstuck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YANSS 230 - Britt Frankâ€™s advice for escaping life loops...</a>
  </li>

  </li>

  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/427/teamwork-makes-the-dream-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syntax.FM - Teamwork Makes The Dream Work</a>
  </li>
</ul>

I also wanted to improve my knowledge of the current events happening around the world so I tried to read and watch the news as much as possible, though it can be tiring sometimes.

I also created this portfolio site so that I can have something that I will have to regularly maintain. I want this portfolio site to show my progress in my web development skills. I also dabbled in using Symfony so that I can learn another framework. I was able to create projects using Symfony, <a href="https://github.com/iusiel/custom_news_display">Custom News Display</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iusiel/lap_times_saver">Lap Times Saver</a>. I still want to improve my Symfony skills since I am not yet satisfied with my current skill level.

Due to my focus on the things I mentioned above, I was not able to watch that much, but I came across "Bocchi the rock" by chance. I tried to watch it and I enjoyed it. I hope there will be a second season for this anime. This anime also inspired me to try out the guitar though I am not sure if I will have the motivation to continue learning the guitar.

Overall, I think 2022 is a good year for me though how the year ended was a downer (holiday blues). I hope 2023 will be good for me and I will still have the motivation to continue improving myself.
