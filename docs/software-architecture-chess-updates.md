I found a good deal in the humble bundle store recently. It was a book bundle about software architecture. I know some bits about software architecture. I decided to buy it because I felt it would help me make better decisions as a developer if I were more knowledgeable about software architecture. The book I am currently reading is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-systems-thinking/9781098151324/" target="_blank">Learning Systems Thinking by Diana Montalion.</a> I liked what I have read so far. I think the concepts are very relatable to me and I hope I can implement them in the future.

I am going to host a "tournament" where I will be playing with various chess engines though not at their maximum potential. For now, I named it "Chess Engines Invitational 1". There will be 5 players in this tournament. The players are me, Stockfish 16, PyChess, Dragon Engine and Stockfish 17. All of the chess engines will be at level 3. It is a double round-robin format with one match per player per week. It is a 60+30 time format event. I am excited about how it will turn out. I hope that it will be a good learning experience for me. I am also checking out other books that I want to buy. Even though I do not play that much, I find studying chess concepts fun.

I hope I can improve the work by implementing a better system for how I approach my work. So far, I think I am doing an adequate job at my work, but I feel like I can still be better than what I am right now. I hope that the system that I created will point me in the right direction.

I think this will be my last update for the year. I am going to revamp the site. I think I will update the design. I will also update how the application works internally. I feel that it is starting to become unmaintainable. Those are the issues that I am going to tackle with this revamp.
