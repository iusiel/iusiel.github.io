I tried Svelte for a bit as part of "legendary palm tree". I am not still sure how it is different from Astro, but I found Svelte easy to use. For now, I am trying to build my R6 strategy and tactics list using Svelte. I am also planning to build a web application that will show a random "flash card" every time I access it. The flash card will be short and will serve as something that I can easily read and digest when I am feeling down or bored. The flashcards will be sorted according to categories. I will be using Astro for this one. I am also planning to turn it into a PWA (Progressive Web App).

As for chess, I am continuing to try to improve by learning various chess books. I am currently reading How To Beat Your Dad at Chess. The book that I have ordered, Winning Chess Tactics, has also arrived. It was quite a thick book so I think I will be reading it for quite a while. I enjoy playing chess against bots but maybe it is time to try playing against other humans.
