I started developing an app that will act like flashcards, though it is not meant for studying purposes. The random name that GitHub gave to me was probable-train. It will be used as a random reminder for me. This is different from PAASRS (Poor Attempt at Spaced Repetition Software). I am using Astro for this project. I made decent progress with this one. I have finished the main page, the deck page, and the card page. I think the next part will be to apply some styling to it.

For the R6 tactics app, I have finished the layout and functionality. There are a few bells and whistles for this one. I did not want to make it complicated. I also started adding information that I intend to use during my games. The next step for this will be to turn this into a PWA (Progressive Web App).

I also continued my chess journey. For now, I have created an account on <a href="https://lichess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lichess</a>. I have won my first battle against another human on lichess. It was quite a thrilling match for me. The next step for me will be continuing to read chess books. I also downloaded PyChess which I will use as together with Stockfish for analysis. I enjoy playing chess though I still make big mistakes from time to time. This is something that I should improve upon.
