Due to some things that happened this past week, I decided to reschedule my 10k time trial. I will hopefully get to do it on October 21. I think it lines up nicely so that I can have another week of taper. I am not still sure how I will perform but I will be pleasantly surprised if I managed to do it below 60 minutes.

The site revamp has not yet started. I hope that I can start doing it sooner rather than later. I am also excited to test some things that I have learned from listening to developer podcasts. I hope I can give some updates about it sometime in the future.
