The new guitar strings and tuning pegs have arrived. I managed to replace the guitar strings and tuning pegs. My restringing skills need work as the knot in the tuning peg does not look clean, but at least the guitar sounds fine. I have also started practicing playing the guitar. Right now, I am learning how to play the D and A chords.

I am pretty pleased with my training. I ran consistently this week. Due to that, I added some mileage to my body. I am also glad about the variety that I am doing while training so I am not easily bored. On some days, I ran on straight roads while on other days, I ran on the hills. I am not sure if I should aim for a time finish in the upcoming 10k race or if I should just try to finish the event.

I tried using ChatGPT and it was pretty interesting. On some topics, it was able to answer correctly while on some topics, it did not answer correctly. This is fascinating and I wonder how it will affect the future.
