I almost stopped playing the guitar. I am not happy with my progress and feel that I am just wasting my time. I know it will be hard, but I was disappointed with my progress after a year. I thought I would be better by now, but it is not happening. Maybe I'll just give away the guitar so someone else can use it.

I hit some roadblocks in my running. Phases 2 and 3 of the Red Plan did not go as expected. I was missing some sessions. I wonder if it is due to a lack of motivation or the running sessions being too hard. I want to finish Phase 4 on a strong note. After that, I will revisit how I do my training runs.

I think I have improved a bit with chess. I am trying new things out like doing Nimzo-Indian defense if my opponent plays 1. d4 and playing Sicilian defense if my opponent does 1. e4. I am enjoying chess right now though I try not to overdo it. My Lichess Puzzle rating is almost 2400. I hope I can break through it sooner than later.

I hope to deploy various side projects before the year-end. The expenses tracker is almost finished. Maybe I should just do a final update and then deploy it so that I can use it. I am also planning on developing software for tracking my chess progress. I had some ideas on what to do due to reading Perpetual Chess Improvement. I like the book and I want to reread it some time again.
