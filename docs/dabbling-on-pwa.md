I have made some PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) earlier in my dev career, but I feel like I was not able to take advantage of the full features of a PWA. Because of that, I want to try creating one again. I will turn probable train into a PWA. I think the main feature that I want to implement for now is the offline functionality. It means that it does not need an internet connection to function properly. I will learn via this course <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa">Learn PWA by web.dev</a>
