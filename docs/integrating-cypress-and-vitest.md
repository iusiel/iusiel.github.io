In my quest to continue improving my web development skills, I am trying to integrate Cypress and Vitest into my default workflow since I think they will make a big impact on the quality of things that I make. So far, I was able to integrate it to my two bootstrap frameworks for Laravel and Symfony. I create custom functions that will auto-generate Cypress and Vitest test cases. I had fun while creating this functions because I think it helped me improve a little bit. The next step for me now is to integrate this into my current workflow.
