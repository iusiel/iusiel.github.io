Looks like my R6 training is paying off because I am getting used to some of the maps. Now I just need to test it in-game.

[The International](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International/2022) and [LoL Worlds](https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/World_Championship/2022) are ongoing right now. I don't cheer for a particular team right now. I just want to watch high-level play and entertaining matches.

I have also started learning GraphQL. I think I somewhat know the basics on how to query a GraphQL API and to also create a GraphQL server. Maybe I can make some posts in the coming weeks about my experiences learning GraphQL.
