My reason for creating a chess helper app is that I want a better way to track some stats instead of manually adding them to the current spreadsheet that I am using. I think this is also a good way to sharpen my skills as a web developer. For now, I am planning on using Astro. I will not be using any database for now and all calculations will be done on build time. If needed, I think I will switch to Symfony. I believe it has also been a while since I used Symfony. I hope I can make a good application out of this.

On a non-chess-related update, I am interested in some running books that tackle the mental side. I feel like my mental fortitude is lagging right now. I want to improve it. I also don't want to skip any more runs. I think I have already missed too many of them. I am dreading that I will not be in peak condition come the 5k race. Nonetheless, I should change my mindset and give it everything I have.
