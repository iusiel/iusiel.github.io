I am trying to read regularly right now. While trying to do this, I have realized that I may become addicted to this so I am making sure that I only do it on small doses. I encountered this while trying to improve my chess. That is why I am trying to avoid overdoing it. The book that I am currently reading right now is You Are Not So Smart by David McRaney. At first, I thought it was quite boring but now I am finding it enjoyable to read as it goes on. I am interested in improving my critical thinking and I think this book will help find flaws in how I think and approach situations. The next books that I want to read are Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg and Think Again by Adam Grant. I am especially excited about Think Again since I liked listening to Adam Grant's podcast, Worklife.

I played some chess games against Stockfish 16 around levels 1 to 3. I am somewhat proud that I am starting to see some improvements in my chess play. Right now, I am going through 100 Endgames You Must Know by Jesus de la Villa, Mastering Chess Strategy by Johan Hellsten, and Fundamental Chess Openings by Paul Van der Sterren. I especially liked going through the material of 100 Endgames and Mastering Chess Strategy. I am also going through the puzzle books, Chess: 5334 Problems and Perfect Your Chess. I want to read the books as fast as possible, but I think that is a waste of time if I don't attempt to understand it thoroughly so I am taking it slow and steady.

As for running, I think my injury is healing well. I do not experience any mild discomfort so I think that is a good sign. If all goes well, I think I will participate in a 5K race by August.
