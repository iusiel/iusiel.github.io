I upgrade some parts of my PC that I built in 2017. I upgraded my Ryzen 5 1400 to Ryzen 5 5600. Luckily, my MSI B350M Bazooka motherboard can support the Zen 3 architecture (Ryzen 5000 series) though I needed to update my motherboard BIOS. It was quite a hard experience since I have forgotten how to install a CPU cooler properly. I also upgraded my GPU from GTX 1050 to RX 6600. After some unfortunate accidents (the power switch cable in my case not being connected to the motherboard), I think the upgrade went smoothly. I am also quite satisfied with its performance though the temps of my CPU leave much to be desired. I think I was not able to mount the cooler properly.

On an unrelated note, I enjoyed watching Bocchi the Rock! This anime was not on my radar at all. I hope that it will continue the good momentum it has until the final episode. I think the current episode is 9 while the total number of episodes for the anime is 12.
