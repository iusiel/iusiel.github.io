It looks like I have accomplished my goal. My official result is 02:29:43. I am pretty satisfied with how I ran but after seeing the official result, I was really glad. All the hard training paid off. I was also starting to get skeptical about the training provided by Garmin coach app, but it looks like it was a good plan after all. Maybe I&#39;ll use it again someday but for my next run, I am planning to use a new training plan. I have not decided on the distance that I want to run next, but I want to target a 10km event since I have not run that one yet (though I did run a few 10km easy runs during training). <p>Sadly, I will be putting the storybook software on indefinite hiatus. I have tried to finish this application under multiple iterations many times but it looks like my heart is not into it after all. Maybe I&#39;ll try to continue it again sometime but for now, I have no plans of continuing developing it. However, I came up with some new ideas for some side projects that I want to do, but I&#39;ll just say it another time since I am not planning on starting them yet. What I will do for now is start a side project that I thought of last year. I am calling it &quot;Should you buy a game?&quot;. What it does is tell you if you should buy a brand-new game or not. My inspiration for doing this is that I have too many games that I haven&#39;t played yet, but I continue to buy new games, especially during sales. I want this application to remind me that I still have some games that I can play so I should not be rushing to always buy new ones. For now, I am planning to use Laravel and VueJS as the main tools for this one.</p></div><!--]--></section><br><a href="/random-things">Check out other posts.</a></div></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="footer__content"><div>Created with VuePress.</div><a class="footer__link" href="https://github.com/iusiel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a><div></div></div></footer></div></div></div>
