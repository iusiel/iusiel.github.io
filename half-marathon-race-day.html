That is why I am not able to give updates regularly. Overall, I think my April training went well. I thought that my good training will continue through May. Unfortunately, that is what did not happen. I got sick so I was forced to miss about a week&#39;s worth of running workouts. I also got sidelined in my training because I was also focusing on some other things. I also lost confidence along the way because I felt that I am not doing well in my last workouts even though I am not running at my target goal pace. My sleep schedule was also out of whack so I felt that I am not recovering well enough. <p>Race day is here. I tried to get some sleep but I was not able to. I will try to implement a simple strategy for this race. I will divide this race into three main parts with each part consisting of 7 km. For the first 7 km, I am planning to run at a pace of 7:27. For km 8-14, I will run at my intended goal pace of 7:07. For the final 7 kilometers if I can, I will try to run at a pace of 6:47. I planned to do a negative split for this race.</p><p>For the first 7 km, I felt fine and I was able to follow my strategy properly. The only setback is that I was slower on the first kilometer since I can&#39;t separate myself from the crowd. For the next 7 km, I was starting to feel some aches, but I was able to run at my goal pace with no issue at all. For the final 7 km, I am starting to feel tired. I was able to run km 15-17 at my intended pace, but I am starting to feel the aches. I also started to do some walk breaks. Kilometer 20 is where I felt that I just wanted to give up. I took a very long walk break around here. I thought that it was the end for me. But I managed to find the strength to finish the remaining two kilometers by implementing a sprint walk strategy. I was surprised that I was able to maintain a good pace by using this strategy. The final part before the finish line was a bit comedic because I took a walk break not realizing that I was near the finish line. When I saw the finish line, I just sprinted all the way. Overall, my unofficial time is 02:30:29 (I am not yet able to confirm the initial results). I was off by 29 seconds on my target, but I am proud of this run. My confidence was low before the race so I thought that I will not be near my target goal. I also learned new things about myself during this run. Looks like I can maintain a walk-sprint strategy even if I am already tired.</p><p>Here are my times per km:</p><ul><li>KM 1 - 8:09</li><li>KM 2 - 7:16</li><li>KM 3 - 7:21</li><li>KM 4 - 7:19</li><li>KM 5 - 7:14</li><li>KM 6 - 7:09</li><li>KM 7 - 7:09</li><li>KM 8 - 7:05</li><li>KM 9 - 7:02</li><li>KM 10 - 7:00</li><li>KM 11 - 6:57</li><li>KM 12 - 7:03</li><li>KM 13 - 6:58</li><li>KM 14 - 6:53</li><li>KM 15 - 6:54</li><li>KM 16 - 6:38</li><li>KM 17 - 6:39</li><li>KM 18 - 7:02</li><li>KM 19 - 7:10</li><li>KM 20 - 7:50</li><li>KM 21 - 6:58</li><li>Final 100m - 0:31</li></ul><p>The month of May was hectic for me because I felt that I was not able to do many things. This June, I hope to bring some normalcy back to my routines.</p></div><!--]--></section><br><a href="/random-things">Check out other posts.</a></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="footer__content"><div>Created with VitePress.</div><a class="footer__link" href="https://github.com/iusiel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> | <a class="footer__link" href="mailto:iusiel@outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iusiel@outlook.com</a><div></div></div></footer></div></div></div>
