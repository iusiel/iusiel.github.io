It looks like I have accomplished my goal. My official result is 02:29:43. I am pretty satisfied with how I ran but after seeing the official result, I was really glad. All the hard training paid off. I was also starting to get skeptical about the training provided by Garmin coach app, but it looks like it was a good plan after all. Maybe I'll use it again someday but for my next run, I am planning to use a new training plan. I have not decided on the distance that I want to run next, but I want to target a 10km event since I have not run that one yet (though I did run a few 10km easy runs during training). "),t("p",null,`Sadly, I will be putting the storybook software on indefinite hiatus. I have tried to finish this application under multiple iterations many times but it looks like my heart is not into it after all. Maybe I'll try to continue it again sometime but for now, I have no plans of continuing developing it. However, I came up with some new ideas for some side projects that I want to do, but I'll just say it another time since I am not planning on starting them yet. What I will do for now is start a side project that I thought of last year. I am calling it "Should you buy a game?". What it does is tell you if you should buy a brand-new game or not. My inspiration for doing this is that I have too many games that I haven't played yet, but I continue to buy new games, especially during sales. I want this application to remind me that I still have some games that I can play so I should not be rushing to always buy new ones. For now, I am planning to use Laravel and VueJS as the main tools for this one.`)],-1),p=JSON.parse('{"title":"Official Half Marathon Results and Updates on Personal Projects","description":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Official Half Marathon Results and Updates on Personal Projects","date":"2023-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","meta":[{"name":"description","content":"An update on my official half marathon and some projects that I aim to finish this year"},{"property":"og:image","content":"/images/logo.jpg"},{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],"activeLink":"random"},"headers":[],"relativePath":"official-half-marathon-result-personal-project-updates.md"}'),r={name:"official-half-marathon-result-personal-project-updates.md"},f=Object.assign(r,{setup(h){return(u,d)=>(e(),o("div",null,[n(a,null,{default:i(()=>[l]),_:1})]))}});export{p as __pageData,f as default};
