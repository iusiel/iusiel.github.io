I think it is a good plan especially for beginners though phase 4 is somewhat challenging. I am glad to have finished it. It also looks like my injury has healed though sometimes I can still feel some slight pain when I bend my ankle. As the finale for the white plan, I decided to do a 5k time trial. It was a really hard run for me because I ran full effort. I was not expecting anything, but I am glad that I was able to get a new 5k PB which was 32:37. I will now tackle the red plan in preparation for the Hoka Trilogy Run Leg 3. I am planning to race a 5k at that event. So far, I do not have any targets though I would be glad to get a sub-30-minute time.
