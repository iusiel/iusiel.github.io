For now, I have finished the initial page layout. It has a very simple design with the text "Should You Buy A Game?" and the corresponding answer. I am not planning to make the UI too flashy. I will focus more on UX. For now, I will be implementing a very simple algorithm. If you have 50% or more games in your list that you have not played yet, the answer will be "No". If you have played about 60% of your list, the answer will be "Buy if the game is cheap". If you have played around 80% of your games list, the answer will be "Yes". I will refine this as the project goes along, but I think this is good enough for a basic implementation.
