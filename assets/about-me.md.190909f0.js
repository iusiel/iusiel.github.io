I mostly use PHP as my backend language. I have also used WordPress, Drupal, and Magento2 in the past, but my knowledge here is not updated since I don&#39;t regularly use them. To keep my skills and knowledge up to date, I listen to podcasts related to web development. I also check some roadmaps that other web developers have created. You can check my Github page <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/iusiel">https://github.com/iusiel</a> to learn about various projects I do during my free time. </p><h2>When I am not doing projects</h2><p> I like to play games when I am not doing anything related to web development. Right now, I mostly play Stardew Valley, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and Dirt Rally 2.0. I also like to improve my critical thinking by learning about various logical fallacies and logical biases. I try to keep up with local and international news to have an informed opinion. </p><h2>You want to work with me?</h2><p> You can email me at <a href="mailto:iusiel@outlook.com">iusiel@outlook.com</a></p><h2>What is next for me?</h2><p>Some ideas that I have for my next projects are:</p><ul><li> Sports league website. I was inspired to try and create this one since I play OOTP sometimes. </li><li> Warranty reminder. I think I am going to try either Flutter or React Native for this one. </li><li>Storybook interface.</li></ul>',8);function k(a,o,s,v,w,S){return e(),t("div",null,[g,a.$frontmatter.skills.length>0?(e(),t("div",y,[(e(!0),t(l,null,c(a.$frontmatter.skills,(i,r)=>(e(),t("div",{key:r,class:"about__skill"},p(i),1))),128))])):m("",!0),b])}const f=n(_,[["render",k]]),T=JSON.parse('{"title":"About Me","description":"","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","meta":[{"name":"description","content":"How I describe myself."},{"property":"og:image","content":"/images/logo.jpg"},{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],"activeLink":"about","skills":["PHP 8","Laravel 8","Vue 3","VitePress","Symfony 6"]},"headers":[],"relativePath":"about-me.md"}'),I={name:"about-me.md"},V=Object.assign(I,{setup(a){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[h(f)]))}});export{T as __pageData,V as default};
